I have created a user registration for multiple users. So new users can be created.

I have also submitted SQL file with all information

The users in the database are:
username:smith || password::mypass
username:sangramb || password:password

In Board.php, when you post a new message the "Message Box" i.e textarea cannot be empty and
while replying to any messages the "Message Box" i.e textarea also cannot be empty.

For example: if a user is posting a new post, he has to type some message in the Message box and press "New Post" button and
if a user is replying to some message, he has to type some message in the Message box and press "Reply" button of that specific message he is relying to.
